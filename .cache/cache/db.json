Going to work and back with little time to spend on myself has been a daily routine for quite a time now. Well I also had to try out my s9 camera on some good landscapes.So I decided to leave for Pokhara. <strong>Since</strong> there was a holiday in buddhajayenti and I took a leave for day after from office resulting in 4 days off from office including weekends. Since It would take a whole day to reach Pokhara from Kathmandu , I had already wasted my two days of my short vacation. I packed my kindle with <strong>The Alchemist</strong> Paulo Coelo for a reread during my trip. I have been getting recommendation of <strong>Norwegian Wood</strong> from a coworker, Maybe I will read that next time. Next day I meet up with old pal and decided to go to TatoPani resort near Pokhara.We set off around 5 pm and reached at our destination about 7 pm.
