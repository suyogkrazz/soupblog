The past few months have been hectic for me, with all the Assignments, Field studies, Presentations and Exams from my University, I've been struggling to be efficient and haven't been able to get things done. I've been procrastinating a lot.

**So? Is this going to be about me whining and complaining about life ?**
Kinda yes ,yeah, **NO!** ,not really, In these recent unproductive and stress fueled time i have somehow managed to finish this amazing book recommended to me by my brother. Not having anything else to do (Besides playing Fortnite and Dota 2 ) I decided why not give "Book Reading" a shot and this Review is what I've come up with. As pretentious and corny the lines may sound I hope you'll stick till the end where i mention "something special".

## THE SUBTLE ART OF NOT GIVING A F\*CK

As eye catching the title of the book is, indulging are the concepts and chapters of this book. This book really is quite something as I got hooked as soon as I started reading it. Basically what Mark Manson (Author) states in the book is:

* F\*ck positivity - Let’s be honest; sometimes things are fucked up and we have to live with it.
* Stop trying to be Extraordinary- there are winners and losers in society, and some if it is not fair or your fault.
* Stop seeking happiness - The path to happiness is a path full of shit heaps and shame.

As bizarre and abstract the ideas in the books were, I personally enjoyed them and found them to be relatable. Mark introduces us with this concept of "Not Trying Too Hard In Life". This way Mark explores Human Problems, Sufferings and Failures and emphasizes on what is really worth in our lives and it makes us think about what we've been valuing in our lives.

**“The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.”**

Reading this book was an experience, I'm exploring the concepts of this book in my life slowly, the fact that I've been only seeking out for good vibes and easy highs through out my life while ignoring my problems has really stuck a cord in me. This book has helped me accept this realization and encourages me to face my problems, it challenges me to seek and create more probabilities and problems and even if i fail, I''ll have to embrace it and deal with it instead of making excuses about it .
As I'm learning to give fewer f\*cks, I'm starting to look out for things that truly matter in my life. I've also come to a realization that what we struggle for is what we will succeed in, and as I'm writing this post I still doubt myself for what I am struggling for. I've learnt to question my values and give up on my bad values for genuine and healthy values.I feel encouraged by this book to take responsibility for my response under any circumstances and. I If you're still genuinely reading this post here is the "something special" i was going to mention(Yeah I know lame).

This book has been a lot to take in but this is one of the best experiences I've had in quite a while. I've decided on reading more books and getting myself out there. I'll probably circle back to it a few more times in the future.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for some good Self-Help books 10/10.
